										<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
										<h5>Fixed Deposit</h5>
										
										<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
										<p>"Traditional Fixed Deposits" are fixed deposits where interest is paid at regular intervals, i.e., Quarterly or Monthly, as requested by the Customer/s at the time of creating the fixed deposits.</p>

										<p>"Cumulative Fixed Deposits" are fixed deposits where interest is compounded quarterly and reinvested with principal amount.</p>

										<p>"Maturity Value" shall mean the amount payable to the customer at the end of the term of the fixed deposit subject to deduction of any tax as may be applicable.</p>

										<h6>Date of Fixed Deposit</h6>
										<ul>
											<li>The effective date of fixed deposit shall be the date on which the amounts of deposit placed are realized by / credited to Mchurner Nidhi Limited. No fixed deposit advice will be issued in anticipation of realisation of cheque/s in relation to any deposit and will be issued only on actual receipt of payment / deposit monies.</li>
											<li>In case requests for opening fixed deposits are received on 2nd and 4th Saturday or Sunday or holiday through electronic channels like Internet or any other electronic channel, the fixed deposit will be opened with value date of the next business working day.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<h6>Fixed Deposit Receipt / Fixed Deposit Advice</h6>
										<ul>
											<li>At the time of placing the fixed deposit if the Customer does not opt for a Fixed Deposit Receipt, an Advice shall be issued by Mchurner Nidhi by default. In cases where Auto Renewal or Auto Closure option is selected by the Customer, an electronic Fixed Deposit Advice shall be sent to the Customer on his registered email id updated with the Bank. However, a Fixed Deposit Receipt or a physical Fixed Deposit Advice will be made available to the Customer on specific request. If email id of the Customer is not registered with Mchurner Nidhi then physical Fixed Deposit Advice shall be issued to the Customer.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<h6>Payment of Interest on Fixed Deposit</h6>
										<ul>
											<li>Interest on fixed deposits is reckoned/paid at quarterly / monthly intervals and at the rate/s applicable as on the value date of opening of fixed deposits, as the case may be, in accordance with the rate fixed by the Bank from time to time as also directives issued by Reserve Bank of India ("RBI").</li>
											<li>The interest may be paid either in a lump sum at the time of maturity or it may be paid every quarter or every month in accordance with the regulatory payments for payment of interest on the fixed deposit. Where the interest is to be paid by the Nidhi in lump sum at the time of maturity, the fixed deposit shall bear the yearly rate of interest on the fixed deposit.</li>
											<li>The Nidhi may announce special rates for senior citizens and staff</li>
											<li>Customer should not make multiple deposits, across all channels, in a single day in one particular tenor bucket where the applicable interest rate is higher than the rate applicable for the aggregate value of such deposits. In case such multiple deposits are made, the same should be closed and a single deposit for the aggregate value should be made.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<h6>Methodology of interest calculation</h6>
										<ul>
											<li>Interest rates are money market (i.e. simple interest) rates for tenors up to 6 months and quarterly compounded rates for tenors of 6 months and above. However, in case of Traditional fixed deposits interest rates are money market (i.e. simple interest) rates irrespective of the tenor.</li>
											<li>The method of calculation on interest on a fixed deposit, both Traditional and Cumulative deposits is as under:
												<ul>
													<li>For Traditional fixed deposits with quarterly pay-outs interest is calculated based on annual rates (Simple Interest). However, in case of monthly pay-outs, interest is paid at a discounted value. For Traditional fixed deposits with quarterly pay-out, interest is calculated on the principal amount for completed quarters and then for the balance period, interest is calculated for completed months and further for incomplete month on actual number of days.</li>
													<li>For Cumulative deposits, interest is compounded quarterly on completion of exact quarters. For the broken period beyond completed quarters, simple interest is calculated on the cumulated deposit amount for remaining number of days.</li>
													<li>In case of premature withdrawal the interest is calculated on the principal amount for completed quarters and then for the balance period, interest is calculated for completed months and further for incomplete month on actual number of days.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>For the purpose of interest calculation calendar year is taken to consist of 365 days irrespective of whether it is a leap year.</li>
											<li>Term deposit maturing on a holiday (including Sundays and 2nd and 4th Saturday)
												<ul>
													<li>In respect of term deposit (cumulative, recurring and traditional) placed in automatic closure mode and are maturing on a holiday (including Sundays and 2nd and 4th Saturday), the deposit shall be closed on the next working day. Nidhi shall pay interest at the original contracted rate for holiday period on the succeeding working day.</li>
													<li>In case of cumulative deposits and recurring deposits, Nidhi shall pay interest on the maturity value and in case of traditional deposits with interest pay-out option, interest shall be paid on the principal amount</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>

										<h6>Premature/partial closure of Fixed Deposits</h6>
										<ul>
											<li>In the event of the fixed deposit being closed before completing the original term of such deposit, interest will be paid at the rate applicable on the date of deposit for the period for which the deposit has remained with the Nidhi. The deposit may be subject to penal rate of interest as prescribed by the Nidhi on the date of deposit.</li>
											<li>For the deposit amount remaining after the part withdrawal, interest rate will be reset as the rate applicable for the amount remaining, for the original tenure, as prevailing on the date of opening of the deposit.</li>
											<li>In case of the fixed deposit being prematurely closed for the purpose of reinvestment into another scheme of Fixed Deposit, the existing deposit would be subject to penal rate of interest as prescribed by the Nidhi on the date of deposit. Interest will be paid for the period the deposit has remained with the nidhi. The interest rate prevailing on date of re-investment of term deposit will be applicable for the new term deposit.</li>
										</ul>

										<h6>Tax Deducted at Source</h6>
										<ul>
											<li>Tax is deducted at source on interest on fixed deposit held by the resident if the interest paid or payable by the Nidhi for the financial year exceeds the threshold limit specified by Income Tax Act, 1961. Currently, the threshold limit for this purpose is Rs.10,000 p.a.</li>
											<li>For Traditional FD (with quarterly / monthly interest payment), tax is deducted on each interest payment and on interest accrued on March 31st of every year. For Cumulative FD, tax is deducted on interest accrued on March 31st of every year and on maturity. The TDS amount calculated on the accrued interest is remitted to the tax authorities on behalf of the customer by the Nidhi. The interest on the TDS amount from April 1st till maturity of the deposit is adjusted from the interest payable to the client.</li>
											<li>As per provisions of Finance Act 2009, w.e.f. April 01, 2010, valid PAN is required to be submitted by all customers whose tax needs to be deducted. In the absence of a valid PAN, tax will be deducted at the prevailing rate or 20% whichever is higher. Also, Form 15G/H shall not be treated as valid unless PAN is mentioned in such forms.</li>
											<li>In case the deposit holder does not want the Tax to be deducted at source, they may submit Form 15G / 15H (other than company, firm or co-operative society)/ Exemption Certificate under Section 197 (in case of all holders)/ or any other Tax Exemption Certificate with the Nidhi. Such form or tax exemption certificate has to be submitted every financial year for each fixed / recurring deposit held and on each renewal of the deposit.</li>
